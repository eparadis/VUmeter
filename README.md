### VU meter driving circuit

This circuit is designed to drive a ~500uA meter.

It is inspired by and largely based off [the ideas here](http://objectivesounds.co.uk/articles/vu-meter/).

It is setup for a single-sided supply of my own devising, as when I had originally written this up in my notebook, I did not include the original author's single-sided design. Since I was using a single meter but a dual opamp, I had an extra opamp to create a reference voltage. The original author envisioned using each of the opamps as half a stereo pair.
